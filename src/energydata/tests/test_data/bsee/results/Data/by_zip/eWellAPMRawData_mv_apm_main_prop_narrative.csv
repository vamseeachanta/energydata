The well loaded up and ceased production in January, 1997 after producing a cumulative 856 barrels of oil, 35,350,000 cubic feet of gas and 1,953 barrels of water.  A bottom hole pressure survey dated May 1, 2013 indicated the interval has a bottom hole pressure of 3,776 psi at mid-perforations of 7,944' TVD.   The Lower TA interval is estimated to produce 50 barrels of oil per day, 150 barrels of water per day and 50,000 cubic feet of gas per day with gas lift.
