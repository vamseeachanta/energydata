*Note - EB 161 OCSG 2648 A-6 is being turned over to our Well Intervention and Completions Group which handles complex abandonments.  After discussing this well and the recent operations with them, it has been decided that since this well has been shut in and has no future utility it will be abandoned. The WIC group currently has a group of idle wells on the EB 160 platform that were Zonally Isolated in 2012 and are scheduled to be abandoned.  The WIC group is currently gathering resources for this work and will be submitting procedures and APMs to execute this work once the resources are in place.  This well will be included in that scope of work.*
