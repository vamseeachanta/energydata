-4228,"ST 170 F8 Abandonment - Summary Procedure

Notify MMS 24 hrs in advance of job mobilization.  ST 170 is within the Houma District.  The contact for this work is Leslie Peterson at (985) 853-5889 or leslie.m.peterson@mms.gov .  The Houma District 24 hr pager is (985) 580-5367.  Notification needs to be made and approvals gained prior to any major deviation from the procedure.

1.	Mobilize P&A equipment spread including pump, tank, blenders, slickline, wireline and hydraulic jacks.  Hold initial job safety meeting and process APC?s Permit to Work.
2.	Check & record pressures on all annuli.  Test 16? x 20? annulus to 250 psi for 30 min charted.  Test 10-3/4? x 16? annulus to 500 psi for 30 min charted. 
3.	Fill hole and perform bubble test for 1 hr.  Remove dry hole tree.

Objective: Temporary Abandon well as per the attached procedure.  All remaining casings and drive pipe will be removed using mechanical cutters a minimum of 15? below the mudline at a later date when the Platform is removed (if explosives are to be used a seperate permit will be filed with the structure group.)

The District Supervisor will be notified at least 48 hours prior to conducting the clearance survey.  Site clearance will be performed within 60 days after the well is plugged or the platform is removed.  The site clearance verification will be submitted to the District office no later than 30 days with Form MMS-124.

*Note: SPN met with the New Orleans district regarding idle iron and our plan to plug wells in our West Delta Field. These meetings were held because the West Delta Field was close proximity to the mudslide area.  We informed those who attended the meeting (B.J. Kruse, Troy Trosclair, Kevin Karl, Mike Saucier, Lynard Carter and others) that we identified 22 wells SPN would TA within a 2 year period.  This is one of the  wells that SPN has agreed to abandon.

Note: The reason Arena is not able to squeeze the L-2 Sand before coming uphole to the L-1 Sand is due the platform is not large enough to support a coil tubing unit and the water depth is too deep to utilize a liftboat for the squeeze work.

Additional Note:  Arena will pull the PX plug and the L-2 Sand will be squeezed upon depletion of the L-1 Sand.
