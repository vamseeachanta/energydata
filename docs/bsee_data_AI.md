#### Objective

* For a given API well or block, get data from BSEE website and perform analysis that we have done back in 2022.

* Then progress further to drilling statistics, well plans, risk, safety events etc.

* Then I believe will allow people to use AI .

a/ data method :

legacy: download ,
EnergyData:

* Online query (Latest data)
* Read ZIP file directly (Latest data)
* downloading files, loading in database (chance of stale data)
hybrid (online primary, download secondary).

b/ data transformation:

 (Extract-Transform-Load): automate (no manual interruption - all mapping/transformation from data website)

c/ analysis (eg: drilling statistics, well duration, production data, ). A mapped and organized output (json, yaml format ready to unleash AI)

d/ you can run your AI bot on it
